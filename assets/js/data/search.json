IKEA, Huawei, and Schneider are among the subsequent members, and the list continues to increase as additional companies throw their names into the hat. Now as the Matter code repository is open-source under the Apache licence, users can use it for any purpose, distribute it, edit it, and share updated copies of it without paying royalties. The Matter certification, on the other hand, is CSA licenced, but more on that later.In 2022, Matter, a smart home protocol that aims to unify device communication across platforms, will be launched. This could happen as early as the first half of 2022, according to the Connectivity Standards Alliance, formerly known as the Zigbee Alliance.Consumers can expect more consistent, secure connectivity and device compatibility thanks to this new industry standard. It’s a guarantee that devices will function together effortlessly today and tomorrow. It will connect more objects, simplifying development for manufacturers and, as a result, lower consumer prices.Now, let me clarify that last statement; if manufacturers’ production is simplified, this should lower end-user costs; however, even if it doesn’t, you can bet it will be cheaper when a company goes out of business and their product is no longer supported; you will still be able to use it, which means you won’t have to re-invest any money to replace what you already have.What is Matter?Matter is a brand-new method for smart home devices to communicate and connect. It’s a wireless, IP-based mesh network technology similar to Z-wave and Zigbee. The goal is to establish a communication standard that does not confine your devices to certain hubs or smart home platforms. So, in principle, you’ll be able to utilise Google Assistant, Apple Homekit, or Home Assistant with your Amazon devices or Philips Hue devices.When Matter is launched, it will be compatible with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, and Thread, a competing wireless mesh network protocol aimed at low-power battery-powered devices that Matter is based on. As a result, many of the companies mentioned above took the initial step by announcing Thread integration for their devices. This will allow them to use the Matter protocol, which enables them to work with a wider range of smart home systems, devices and voice assistants.For the typical end-user, all of this may seem complex, but the bottom line is that smart home products will require Matter support to keep up with the future of the smart home industry.Certification at a GlanceMatter CertificationThe certification process mainly consists of 2 stages: Product Testing &amp;amp; Application for Certificateflowchart LRA(Product) --&amp;gt; B{Product Testing}B --&amp;gt; C[Pass]B --&amp;gt; D[Fail]D --&amp;gt;|Re-Test| BC --&amp;gt; E{Application}E --&amp;gt; F[Pass]E --&amp;gt; G[Fail]G --&amp;gt;|Re-Apply| EF --&amp;gt;|Recieve| H(Certificate)Product Testing: Upon successful testing, an application for a certificate, which is good for 10-years can be submitted. Once the application is approved the product gets immediately put into the Connectivity Standards Alliance database of Certified Products. Requirements: Certification is only available to Connectivity Standards Alliance members. All new product certifications require product testing at a Connectivity Standards Alliance Authorized Test Provider, followed by an application with the Connectivity Standards Alliance with their Certification Tool. Costs: The primary costs associated with product certification are the testing and application fees. So, if you’re just getting started with smart home devices or adding more to your house, before you run out and buy any new devices check for Matter compatibility. It’s going to… matter!

This sensor is based on the likelihood of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of elements that may be connected with said event.  ProTip: You can watch on YouTube instead of reading this!BackgroundBayes’ theorem, or the Bayesian Sensor in our case, is a concept in probability theory and statistics named after Thomas Bayes that describes the likelihood of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of elements that may be connected with said event. We’re using Bayesian inference for the Home Assistant integration, which is a statistical inference method that leverages Bayes’ theorem to update the probability of an occurrence as new data or information becomes available.Start with the wiki page if you want to learn more; that’s where I started, and besides I’d be doing you a disservice if I went any farther into the background of this topic. Also, this specific integration was released so long ago, on September 9, 2017, and it’s only used by 625 active installations at the time of filming, I mean come on, this is a powerful integration that almost no one is using. And yes, I understand that this number may be skewed because not everyone shares anonymous information with the Home Assistant team, and maybe it is representative of the number of people using it, but that’s still a pretty low number in my opinion.It is for reasons like these that we should all be sharing our data with the team, which I believe is a minor inconvenience given that this software is open source!; Otherwise, they may stop maintaining low-use integrations or remove them completely and we wouldn’t want a great integration like this to be removed! ConfigurationSo, how can we take advantage of this integration I’m referring to? That’s an excellent question. To begin using this powerful integration, we simply need to add a few lines to our configuration.yaml file, that’s it, easy right? Well, it really is that simple, but let us first understand some of the variables.So, the first thing we will do after we open VS Code, or however you edit your yaml files is to open the Home Assistant web page then open ‘Binary Sensors’ from the integrations page and click on Bayesian. Then we scroll down a little to the section called “Configuration Variables”, here it lists all the required variables we need. Starting from the top and working our way down, the first variable we see is “prior”, this is the starting probability for our event, weighted based on the likelihood of this event happening without outside influence, i.e. the sun rising verus a light turning on.Don’t worry about the weights for these variables right now; we’ll get to them later, and I’ll share a tool with you that will make it a lot easier. Moving on, we have the probability threshold, which defaults to 0.5 unless we change it, and tells Home Assistant when it may switch on our bayesian sensor. Finally, we have the name for our sensor, which I prefer to use because we’ll be utilizing it for some more complex automations.Okay, now comes the real strength of this integration: the observations, and you’ll repeat these steps for each additional condition you add, as we’ll see in the example. First, we must declare the platform we will be using, which can be one of three types: state, numeric state, or template. They provide us three full examples to demonstrate how these function below, but after we decide which platform to use, the next one is entity ID, which is the entity we are monitoring for a change if we chose state or numeric state.If we’re using a template, the value template comes next, and this is where you define the template parameters. The probability given true is then required and simply means that this will be the new probability if it is active, followed by the probability given false, which defaults to 1 minus the probability given true unless we want to weight it differently, and finally the to state, which is used to monitor state change when using state or numeric state. " } ]
