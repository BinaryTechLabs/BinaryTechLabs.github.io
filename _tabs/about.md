Welcome to Binary Tech Labs, my goal is to provide tutorials, reviews, and other content that will help people learn more about Home Assistant, IoT devices, Raspberry Pi's and other Single Board Computers as well as, other various technologies. I've been experimenting with Raspberry Pi's and microcontrollers for a while now, and I really enjoy them. The amazing thing about these devices is that they're inexpensive so you can get started right away.
