Welcome to Binary Tech Labs, where my goal is to create tutorials, reviews, and other content that will assist people in learning more about Home Assistant, IoT devices, Raspberry Pi's and other Single Board Computers, as well as other technologies. For a long time now, I've been exploring electronics and technology, which I do truly enjoy.

&nbsp;

Electronics and technology intrigued me as a child. I recall receiving a remote control truck as a gift when I was nine years old, before I had any real experience with electronics, and it was supposed to give me with enjoyment. It did, but not in the way that my parents would have expected or been pleased with. That remote control truck was the beginning of my interest with electronics and technology, because the first thing I did was disassemble it to understand how everything worked. It wasn't until I was older that I began to focus my spare time to learning various knowledge about computers and electronics, such as programming and hardware.

&nbsp;

I spent hours on the internet some days looking for new projects I could try, and because I wasn't an expert, I spent even more time reading up on various topics and concepts. As a result of this, I discovered that I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, so technology means a world full of possibilities to me. Through my tutorials, I hope to empower people to go out and build better futures for themselves, the environment, or their communities, and the best part about these devices is that they're inexpensive, so you can get started right away.
